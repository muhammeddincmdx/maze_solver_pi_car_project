# maze_solver_pi_car_project

* This project was developed as part of the Intelligent Mechatronic Systems course, with the objective of autonomously driving a 4WD car using an overhead camera by detecting lane lines and determining the navigation path via the BFS algorithm.

### Last Words...

This project was developed by Ahmet CAN and Muhammed Dinç, with significant assistance from AI tools.

The system uses a webcam, a plastic rectangle to form the maze, two L298N motor drivers, four 6V DC motors, three 3.7V Li-ion batteries, a 20,000mAh power bank, a Raspberry Pi, and an MPU6050 sensor.

The developers initially intended to improve the car’s accuracy using AprilTags and camera feedback, but were unable to complete this part of the project due to certain constraints.

During the project, they realized that precise control of four DC motors is not as easy as it seems, and the friction of the tires can cause additional difficulties when turning left or right.

Although this project may not showcase a high level of creativity, the main goal was to pursue a different approach by using fewer sensors and limited resources.

This was the final project for the Intelligent Mechatronic Systems course, completed in May 2025.
